</center>
The Grierson was troublesome. The two female cousins annoyed Homer, repeating to him their ridiculous notions all the time. Just as the town project was over, Homer decided to leave for a while.<br>
Emily wrote him a letter a week later, telling that they had already gone. So Homer came to the town again.<br>
People in the town asked him if he was planning to marry Emily this time and said that Emily had already bought a lot of new things for him. Homer had always known that the townspeople liked to talk about Emily. He had often heard such things from them when he first came here. For example, none of the young men were quite good enough for Miss Emily and such.<br>
Homer heard it as a joke. But if he hadn't heard the joke, he probably wouldn't have interests in Emily, no matter how beautiful she was.<br>
"No." Homer replied.<br>
He didn't want to marry Emily. He didn't think he's a marriageable man, and he didn't think Emily was a marriageable wife either. He knew from the past that Emily was just a quiet and ordinary woman. In addition to keeping her head held high, the Grierson’s identity just created a gap between them. Emily couldn't get over it, and he wasn't going to do so because of the lack of patience.<br>
He came back, only to end everything. After all, the relationship began out of curiosity and a desire to win, not love.<br>
Homer met the town druggist and was asked the same question. And Homer gave the same answer.<br>
The druggist looked hesitant and said, "Well, when you say no to Miss Emily, be careful that you use the smooth words."<br>
Homer asked why. The druggist lowered his voice, "we suspect she's going to kill herself. Because she bought arsenic from me but didn't say what it was for."<br>
The Negro man admit Homer at the kitchen door at dusk.<br>
Emily sat at the dinner table, watching him silently. But Homer has no plan to have dinner. His face is still bright smiling face like the past and he said to Emily, "You see, the streets have been finished. And I'm leaving to work somewhere else."<br>
Emily looked into his eyes.<br>
He continued, "So, Miss Emily, I think that all the stuff you're buying is a waste of time. I’m sorry to say that your money were spent in the wrong place." <br>
Emily kept staring at him.<br>
“I think,” she said, “now it’s not important.”<br>
"Oh, really?" he said, “It's so nice of you to think so."<br>
After a long pause she asked, "Do you hear anyone talking?"<br>
“No.”<br>
"But I hear it. I hear my father's voice."<br>
“But he has gone. I’m sorry about that.”<br>
Emily smiled.<br>
Then she said, "Let's have this last supper together."<br>
Homer stood up and said, "No, thanks. I have already eaten."<br>
Emily was still smiling. She asked, “Or you’d like a drink?” Then she cried,“Tobe!”<br>
Emily rarely smiled like this, and it made Homer nervous. Homer suddenly thought of one thing, "I heard that you bought arsenic?"<br>
The smile on Emily's face vanished in an instant and she stared at Homer quietly.<br>
Homer asked again, "Arsenic. What do you want to do? Do you want to kill yourself? Or something else?"<br>
Emily was silent for a moment. Then suddenly she asked again, "Did you hear my father's voice?"<br>
"Sorry, but..."<br>
"My father is not dead." she interrupted.<br>
Homer looked at her.<br>
"Although they took away my father's body and buried it. Only I know that my father is not dead."<br>
Only Emily knew it.<br>
The majesty of her father remained in her mind as if the blood of the Grierson flowed through her body. Her soul was bound in the body of the Grierson and the escape meant eternal death. Getting out of the mental cage set by her father was the same thing.<br>
When her father drove away the young men from her life, he would always say to her, "They don't deserve you."<br>
"Emily, you're a Grierson." Her father always said to her.<br>
When Emily was young and heard her father's words, she would always remember to hold her head high, to remember her Grierson identity. As she grew older, she found that she needed, even longed for the things her father had banished from her. But she held her head high for so long and her father would not allow her to do so. Although her father deprived her of the ability to love and the opportunity to be loved, he also built her a castle and taught her to live in a different way.<br>
Her father held the key to the cage. When he died, the cage opened wide. But Emily was afraid to get out of the cage. It was another world. There was so much to learn and so much to compromise. Every time she tried to step out of the cage, she heard the sound of blood flowing through her body. <br>
She would hear her father's voice, "Emily, you're a Grierson."<br>
After meeting Homer, she could occasionally hear her father's voice. But on every happy Sunday afternoon, her father's voice seemed to disappear. Then one day she heard Homer said that he was not a man for marriage. At least in Emily's opinion, marriage meant a stable bond. However Homer rejected this relationship. When her two female cousins came, she heard the sound of her own blood flowing through her body again. She heard her cousins said to her, "Emily, you're a Grierson."<br>
It was as if her father had come back from the dead and said to her, "Emily, you're a Grierson."<br>
Homer quietly looked at Emily. He thought Emily was so strange and this kind of strange feeling kept him silent.<br>
The Negro had brought the wine and poured Homer a glass.<br>
Emily smiled, "Would you like me to explain to you? You can drink and listen to me."<br>
Homer sat there and made no movement.<br>
"You know, In the past, you were a man my father would drive away. But he can't stop you now. But he could still stop me. When you decided to leave, my father was still able to stop me from keeping you."<br>
"I don't understand what you're talking about."<br>
"Why don't you take your glass?"<br>
Homer stared at the glass of wine.<br>
The bright red liquid seemed much turbid than usual.<br>
"Why don't you take your glass?"<br>
When Homer heard her question again, it seemed that she was asking something else.<br>
"It's time for me to leave." He said.<br>
"Tobe!" she cried.<br>
The Negro were tall and strong but Homer was also a very strong man and would not be caught so easily. The door has been locked. Homer knocked everything off the table. He was fighting with the Negro, and no one could help him. The Negro did not intend to ignore his master's will, but it seemed that he did not carry it out with all his efforts. Eventually Homer broke the window and escaped through it.<br>
He ran on and on, never once looking back, and he left the town that night.<br>
No one in the town was surprised to see him go. Miss Emily stayed in the house and never came out. Strangely, the Negro with a basket had also not been seen for a long time.<br>
When a bad smell came out of the house, the townspeople pushed open the door and finally found Miss Emily.<br>
"Sure enough, Miss Emily bought arsenic to kill herself."<br>
"Poor Emily."<br>

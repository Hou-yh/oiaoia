Araby describles the birth and death of the romantic but blind love of a boy, which reflects the demand of spiritual world for a boy when he is growing up.
This love is born out of the reality and the need to escape from the real life. In this story, there are a large number of descriptions of scenes to construct and display the spiritual world of the protagonist. It shows the reality of depression, and even the people living in it are also depressed. We can see “the dark muddy lanes” (James Joyce,1), ”dark odorous stables” (James Joyce,2), ”drunken men and bargaining women”(James Joyce,2) and so on. It is just a boring and depressing picture. When the protagonist is depressed by such a picture, for example, when in school or in the flaring streets, the image of Mangan’s sister will come into his mind and he “imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes” (James Joyce,2). The protagonist builds a spiritual world for himself through his hazy love for Mangan's sister, and gets satisfaction and comfort from it. When Mangan's sister appeared, there was always a light and shadow. Light represents a kind of hope, a feeling of joy and a scene of beauty. There must be shadow and dark if there is light. Under the rendering of light and shadow, the charm and fantasy of everything will increase, including Mangan’s sister and love itself. The protagonist can fill his demand of beauty through it. “I was thankful that I could see so little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them” (James Joyce,3). This means that the reality is not so important for the boy. This story is like a dream woven out of the reality. Light and shadow give people a feeling of beauty and even a feeling of unreal. They appear frequently in this narration, which implies that this romantic and fluttering love like light and shadow will finally disillusioned.
The birth of this love is to fight the depression of reality. However it is also shattered by reality finally. Money breaks it. Light and shadow are kind of things that exist in the ideal and imaginary state. But money is closely connected with real life. It is the real life that breaks the narrator's illusions of love. At first, the narrator thinks that Araby is a place with "Eastern enchantment"(James Joyce,4), but at the end of story when the boy arrived at Araby, he saw that "there are two men counting money on a salver and he listened to the fall of the coins." (James Joyce,6)He just realized that Araby is just a common market for money and profit. And the pure love between men and women in his mind is something that can be exchanged with money in the minds of others. So “I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity.” (James Joyce,7)
The love of the protagonist is disillusioned. Or to say that under the collision with reality, the ideal is disillusioned. The author shows the depressing reality through scene description. The boy in the story does not like it. Mangan's sister is like a light, giving the boy the fantasy of love to fill his spiritual world. It is the only way to be out of his depressing real life. People around him don't understand this kind of things, and most people live in the state of numbness. And the boy wants to find the emotional outlet in this environment. But even as he tried to construct his spiritual world, he still couldn't escape from reality in the end.
One in the teenage years, in the process of growing up, he needs a spiritual world to fight the reality. Especially in that century, the development of the industrial world brought people a huge spiritual emptiness. Children were exactly in the period when their hearts and minds jumped. Some of them gradually adapted to the reality and became numb. Some of them tried to resist and escape like the protagonist in the story, but they were finally defeated by the reality. Not to mention that century, even today's children also need their own spiritual world to fight with to combat the anguish and frustration when they are growing up.
